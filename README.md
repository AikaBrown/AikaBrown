# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emiliano Balderas (@ebalderasr)

## About Me
I am a **PhD student** in Biochemical Sciences at the **Instituto de BiotecnologÃ­a, UNAM**, specializing in **cell culture** and **bioprocessing** to enhance the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins. My work combines hands-on bioprocess optimization with advanced analytical and computational approaches.

## Interests
- **Biotechnology & Bioengineering**:
  - Bioprocess modeling and control.
  - Metabolic engineering for improved cell productivity.
  - Development of therapeutic tools, such as CAR-T cell therapies.
- **Technology**:
  - Integration of mechanical, electronic, and computational tools for bioprocess optimization.
- **Data Science**:
  - Python programming for data analysis and visualization.
  - Application of genome-scale models to design and predict bioprocess behaviors.

## What Iâ€™m Working On
- **Cell Culture Optimization**:
  - Improving CHO cell productivity in fed-batch and perfusion bioreactors.
- **Control and Monitoring**:
  - Exploring tools to automate and optimize bioprocess performance.
- **Data-Driven Bioprocessing**:
  - Developing analytical pipelines to process large datasets and extract actionable insights.

## Collaboration
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
- Development of bioengineering tools.
- Bioprocess modeling and simulation.
- Novel therapeutic protein production strategies.
